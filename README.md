# Fiji scripts for processing Zeiss lightsheet Z.1/7 datasets using BigStitcher/ Multiview Reconstruction

These scripts are meant for automatic and easy "happy go lucky" processing of Zeiss Lightsheet datasets using the amazing [BigStitcher](https://imagej.net/BigStitcher) and [MultiView Reconstruction](https://imagej.net/Multiview-Reconstruction) in Fiji.
The goal is to provide a simple, approachable user interface to reduce the barrier of using the Lightsheet system for everyday users, for example in a facility environment. 

## Requirements
- BigStitcher >= 0.8.1
- Multiview Reconstruction >= 10.2

If you would like to use the "convert to Imaris" function, 
- Imaris FileConverter (Windows)
- kindly ask @ImageJan for his permission to use his convert-to-ims Fiji plugin

If you would like to use the mailing function,
- please change the smtp server settings according to your institute
